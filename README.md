# PubMed Fetcher

`pubmed-fetcher` is a Python tool designed to fetch research papers from PubMed and extract relevant information into CSV files. Below are the steps to run the program: 
1. If you dont already have poetry, run pip install poetry
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run : cd pubmed-fetcher
4. Run : poetry install --no-root
5. To use, use command : poetry run get-papers-list "YOUR QUERY" -f YOUR-FILE-NAME.csv -d
6. If you don't want the file to be saved then you can skip the -f parameter, in which case the output will be printed to console.
7. For help use: poetry run get-papers-list -h

## Features

- Fetch PubMed IDs based on a search query.
- Retrieve detailed XML data for given PubMed IDs.
- Extract and parse required fields from PubMed XML data into CSV files.

## Installation

## Usage

To fetch research papers from PubMed, use the command:
```sh
poetry run get-papers-list "YOUR QUERY" -f YOUR-FILE-NAME.csv -d
```

- Replace `"YOUR QUERY"` with your search query.
- Replace `YOUR-FILE-NAME.csv` with the desired output CSV file name.
- If you don't want the file to be saved, you can skip the `-f` parameter, and the output will be printed to the console.

For help, use:
```sh
poetry run get-papers-list -h
```

```

To fetch papers related to "cancer research" and print the results to the console:
